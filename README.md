# Squats_Counter
 
A Computer Vision approach in providing a virtual personalised trainer for squats exercise. The model continuously monitors the body postures through out the exercise and provides visual and auditary support to the user. For the model I have used Mediapipe Pose Estimation model as it easy to implement and provides good accuracy.
